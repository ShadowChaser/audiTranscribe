[0.00s - 4.80s]:  And just can't accept it, this can't be the end yet
[4.80s - 8.40s]:  You promised to never leave
[8.40s - 12.40s]:  And now you're gone, can't believe
[14.80s - 21.60s]:  I can feel the walls have been away
[22.40s - 28.00s]:  As you slowly fade from my everyday
[28.80s - 33.60s]:  You promised forever, I love without it
[33.60s - 38.40s]:  And now I'm left broken, struggling to mend
[38.40s - 44.40s]:  I thought we were so tired, destined for a lifetime
[44.40s - 48.40s]:  I love with nowhere
[49.20s - 52.80s]:  I love with nowhere
[53.60s - 64.80s]:  Staying in my imagination, memorizing the past time
[64.80s - 70.80s]:  The secrets, the love, the care, now they're echoes in the air
[72.80s - 78.80s]:  I still see your face in every place
[78.80s - 82.80s]:  I feel your warmth, your gentle grace
[83.60s - 86.80s]:  But now there's just an act of space
[86.80s - 90.80s]:  And I'm lost in the sinless chase
[92.80s - 100.00s]:  Keeping you in my heart, a piece of you I'll never let go
[100.80s - 104.80s]:  No distance brings separation
[104.80s - 110.00s]:  In my heart, you'll always flow
[110.00s - 116.00s]:  I just can't say goodbye
[116.00s - 120.00s]:  No matter how hard I try
[120.00s - 124.00s]:  I'm born like I was so deep and true
[124.00s - 128.00s]:  I'll always be if you say you'll know
[128.00s - 136.00s]:  I thought we were so tired, destined for a lifetime
[136.00s - 140.00s]:  I love with nowhere
[140.00s - 144.00s]:  I love with nowhere
[158.00s - 164.00s]:  Staying in my imagination, memorizing the past time
