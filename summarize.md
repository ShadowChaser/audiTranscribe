Perfect 👍 since you already got **Whisper (transcription)** working locally, the **summarization** part is actually easier. Let me give you a step-by-step plan for adding it to your study notes app.

---

## 🔹 1. Pick a Summarization Model

Since you want it **local like Whisper**, here are the best open models you can run:

* **LLaMA 3 8B / Mistral 7B Instruct** → can summarize well (general-purpose LLMs).
* **BART / T5 models (e.g., `facebook/bart-large-cnn` or `google/pegasus`)** → specialized for summarization, faster + lighter.
* **Mixtral 8x7B** (if you want high quality and your M4 can handle it).

⚡ Since you’re on an **M4 MacBook Air (24GB RAM)** → you can comfortably run **LLaMA 3 8B** or **Mistral 7B** using [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) (very smooth setup).

---

## 🔹 2. Install Ollama (for LLMs)

```bash
brew install ollama
```

Pull a summarization-capable model:

```bash
ollama pull llama3
```

or

```bash
ollama pull mistral
```

---

## 🔹 3. Run Summarization Locally

You can now run:

```bash
ollama run llama3 "Summarize the following text into concise study notes: <PASTE_TRANSCRIBED_TEXT>"
```

---

## 🔹 4. Connect to Your Transcribe App

Your backend already accepts Whisper transcription. Add another endpoint for summarization.

**Example (Node.js + Express):**

```js
import express from "express";
import bodyParser from "body-parser";
import fetch from "node-fetch";

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Summarize endpoint
app.post("/summarize", async (req, res) => {
  const { text } = req.body;

  const response = await fetch("http://localhost:11434/api/generate", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: "llama3", // or "mistral"
      prompt: `Summarize this into short study notes:\n\n${text}`
    }),
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  res.json({ summary: data.response });
});

app.listen(3001, () => console.log("Summarize API running on http://localhost:3001"));
```

---

## 🔹 5. Frontend Flow

Your web app flow will be:

1. Upload/record → **Whisper** transcribes to text.
2. User clicks **“Summarize”** → sends transcript to `/summarize`.
3. Displays **study note summary**.

---

## 🔹 6. Bonus (Different Summarization Styles)

You can give custom prompts like:

* `"Make bullet-point notes"`
* `"Summarize for a 10-year-old"`
* `"Give 3 key takeaways + 2 examples"`

---

✅ So basically:

* **Whisper** → transcribes speech
* **Ollama + LLaMA/Mistral** → summarizes text locally

---

Do you want me to **write you a complete working doc (backend + frontend code)** just like we did with Whisper, so you can vibe-code your **study notes app**?
